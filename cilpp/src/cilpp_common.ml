     * This rather defeats our attempt at saying "it's for the caller to give us
     * arguments that are well-matched with -real-cpp". EXCEPT IT DOESN'T: it's perfect!
     * The wrapper script *does* give us cc-like arguments, so it needs to give us a
     * cc-like real-cpp. So we never need to drop -Xpreprocessor ourselves. The only
